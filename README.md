# Ladder Token

LADDER is an experimental self-marketmaking token using liquidity bins on Trader Joe v2.1
Forked from White Lotus Token
80% of rebalance goes to floor, 20% goes to wall 
If price moves from wall into floor, the function punishFloorSellers can be activated by anyone to burn the price wall resistance bin.
Because of this new burn mechanic, the sell tax which previously was split between stakers and a burn now all goes to stakers.
This token is an attempt at a store of value cryptocurrency, with a likely floor price. The floor price is not guaranteed. This token is not an investment vehicle, it is an experiment. 
 
LADDER is a fully decentralized protocol. There will be no continued development besides the contracts herein. Full ownership will be revoked and further development
(such as an interface for staking, rebalancing etc) will be the onus of the community
